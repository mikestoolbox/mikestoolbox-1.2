I need your help.

In addition to writing software I have been working on a new economic
theory for the past 15 years which will bring prosperity back to the low
and middle classes.

Despite what we hear from politicians, the U.S. economy is not in good
shape and hasn't been for over a hundred years.  Please read the following
two web pages to learn how the economy actually works and how everything
we think about it is wrong.  We can restore the middle class and bring
prosperity back to every American:

    https://mikestoolbox.com/economy.html
    https://mikestoolbox.com/us-tax-history.html

It's actually very simple, there needs to be just one federal tax, and the
tax rate should be in the single digits, eventually settling in around
just 2%.

We should replace all federal taxes with a low-percentage sales tax.

No more personal income tax, social security and medicare taxes, corporate
taxes, estate or gift tax, tax on capital gains or interest, or any excise
taxes.  All rescinded and replaced by a small national retail sales tax.

When you're done with them, please pass the pages along to friends and
colleagues to gain a wide audience.

Thank you,

Mike
